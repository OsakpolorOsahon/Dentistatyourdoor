[08:00:54.879] (!) Some chunks are larger than 500 kB after minification. Consider:
[08:00:54.880] - Using dynamic import() to code-split the application
[08:00:54.880] - Use build.rollupOptions.output.manualChunks to improve chunking: https://rollupjs.org/configuration-options/#output-manualchunks
